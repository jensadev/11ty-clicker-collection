# Clickersamling

Images are fetched with the `getscreens.js` script using node. It uses puppeteer to capture images and then prints the image names to the console. Images are saved in the `src/previews` folder. It should not fetch images that exists.

The `_data/clickers.js` data need to be updated manually with data from the students.

This automation could use some work :S
